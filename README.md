# School_District_Analysis

## Background
A school district's chief data analyst has asked for assistance in analyzing standardized testing data. Maria has asked to have the data aggregated and to show school performance trends in math and reading. The initial analysis will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budget allotments and priorities. After reviewing the initial analysis, the school board has concluded that there is evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically when looking at Thomas High School ninth graders’ test scores. In order to uphold state-testing standards, the school board has reached out for assistance. The school district analysis is to be repeated after removing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth-graders to determine how it will affect the school performance.
